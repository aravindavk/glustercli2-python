= glustercli2 - GlusterFS CLI Python bindings

Alternative library to https://github.com/gluster/glustercli-python[gluster/glustercli-python]

* Thread safe - No global variables
* Multiple CLI instance can be used - glustercli-python project uses global variables to set the `ssh`, gluster binary path etc. Due to this it is not possible to manage multiple clusters if the environment is different.
* Three supported modes for running the command: `local`, `docker` and `ssh`
* Simple intuitive API design
